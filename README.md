A CSS/HTML/JS challenge from Frontend Mentor 

I created a mobile-first website based on the Frontendmentor.io project "Article Preview". I transitioned to a desktop version using flexbox. I used vanilla Javascript to toggle between the regular/active state (the pop-up social  media icons).

The skills used for this project were learned from a course on CSS design by Maximillian Schwarmuller on Udemy. I also googled extensively when I had issues (making use espicially of Stack Overflow). 

Known bugs: the submit button does not change colors upon activation. Also, depending on screen size for the desktop, the active state is not always directly over the submit.
